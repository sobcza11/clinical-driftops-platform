🧭 Clinical DriftOps Platform

A PMI-CPMAI™-Aligned Framework for Trustworthy Clinical MLOps

Prepared By: Rand Sobczak Jr., PMI-CPMAI™
Version: 1.0 | Date: October 2025

🎯 Purpose & Vision

To create a repeatable, auditable, and ethical MLOps framework for detecting and mitigating model and data drift in clinical AI systems.
Goals: improve model reliability, maintain regulatory compliance, and strengthen clinician trust in decision-support AI.

⚙️ Scope
Component	Description
Primary Function	Drift & bias monitoring for predictive clinical models
Environment	Hybrid Cloud (Azure ML + FHIR-compliant Data Lake)
Model Types	Classification & forecasting (sepsis risk, readmission, adherence)
Boundary	Decision-support only; no direct patient actions without human review
🧩 CPMAI Phase Mapping (I → VI)
Phase	Objective	Key Deliverables
I – Business Understanding	Define clinical problem, KPIs, stakeholders, and ethical boundaries.	Project Charter + Regulatory Scope (HIPAA, FDA GMLP, EU AI Act)
II – Data Understanding	Audit data sources (MIMIC-IV, FHIR); profile drift and bias.	Evidently AI Baseline Report (PSI, KS tests) + Metadata Dictionary
III – Data Preparation	Build clean, PII-safe datasets and feature stores with version tags.	data_prep.py + Data Lineage JSON
IV – Model Development	Implement drift/bias detectors + explainability (SHAP, Evidently).	driftops_service.py microservice + Docker container
V – Model Evaluation	Validate accuracy, fairness, and trustworthiness.	“Trustworthy AI Audit v1.0” report + bias dashboard
VI – Operationalization	Deploy & monitor models with MLflow + Policy-as-Code.	CI/CD workflow + Regulatory Sentinel alerts
⚖️ Compliance & Ethics Anchors

HIPAA — Data de-identification & PHI safeguards

FDA GMLP — Good Machine Learning Practice alignment

EU AI Act — High-risk AI governance obligations

NIST SP 800-53 — Security controls for data pipelines

Human-in-Loop review at every critical decision node

Audit Trails via MLflow + GenAI-authored reports

📊 Key Performance Indicators
KPI	Target	Measurement	Owner
False-alert reduction	≥ 20 % vs baseline	Alert log comparison	Clinical Lead
Drift detection latency	≤ 3 days	PSI/KS pipeline	Data Science Lead
Clinician trust score	≥ 8 / 10	Survey & feedback forms	Compliance Officer
Model AUC stability	≤ 5 % QoQ decay	Validation dashboard	Data Ops Engineer
🚀 Next Steps (Phase II – Data Understanding)

Collect baseline MIMIC-IV v2.2 and/or synthetic FHIR tables.

Profile historical drift and bias patterns (Evidently AI).

Generate metadata dictionary and data risk map.

Branch creation: phase-ii-data-understanding.

🧠 Strategic Alignment

This initiative operationalizes PMI-CPMAI™ within healthcare AI MLOps to demonstrate:

Repeatable AI governance cycles

Regulatory integration from inception to deployment

Continuous trust improvement via drift management and explainability
